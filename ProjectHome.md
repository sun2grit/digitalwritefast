This library consists of a complex header file that translates digitalWriteFast, pinModeFast, digitalReadFast into the corresponding PORT commands. It provides syntax that is as novice-friendly as the arduino's pin manipulation commands but an order of magnitude faster. It can speed things up when the pin number is known at compile time, so that digitalWrite(9,HIGH); is speeded up. On the other hand a loop with digitalWrite(i,HIGH); or a called function with the pin number as a passed argument will not be faster.
